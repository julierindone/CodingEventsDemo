        @*Below - Make sure formsends request to the asp-controller of Events Controller and the asp-action of Add. (These show what METHOD the data is sent to.)*@

    <div class="form-group">
        <label asp-for="Name"></label>      @*Took out the Name text - the label is for the name property of the view model. We can do this because we passed in an empty view model. *I dont get why it doesn't have any text! The "for" attribute only works if the input has an id of "Name". The input is text, and it knows that because the input for the property of Name is a string!*@
        <input asp-for="Name" class="form-control" />
